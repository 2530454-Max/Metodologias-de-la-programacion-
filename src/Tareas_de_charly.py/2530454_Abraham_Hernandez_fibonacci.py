Assignment: Fibonacci Series Generator in Python

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each term is obtained by adding 
the previous two numbers, starting from 0 and 1. This program reads an 
integer n from the user and generates the first n Fibonacci terms. It 
includes input validation to ensure n is a valid integer and n >= 1. A 
loop is used to iteratively compute the sequence. The objective is to 
practice loops, validation, and formatted output in Python
PROBLEM: FIBONACCI SERIES GENERATOR
Description:
Program that reads an integer n and prints the first n terms of the 
Fibonacci series, starting from 0 and 1.

Inputs:
- n (int; number of terms to generate)

Outputs:
- "Fibonacci series:" followed by the n terms separated by spaces"""
"""
Test cases:

1) Normal case:
   Input: number = 7
   Expected output:
   Number of terms: 7
   Fibonacci series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

2) Border case:
   Input: number = 1
   Expected output:
   Number of terms: 1
   Fibonacci series: 0

3) Error case:
   Input: number = "abc"   (non-numeric)
   Expected output:
   error:invalid input

CONCLUSIONS
Using a loop made it possible to build the Fibonacci sequence step by step 
without needing complex formulas. Handling special cases such as n = 1 or 
n = 2 ensures the program behaves correctly for all valid inputs. The logic 
for generating Fibonacci numbers can be reused in other programs that 
require iterative sequences or cumulative calculations.
